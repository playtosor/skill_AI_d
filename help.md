description: Generic convention for adding a HELP! system to any skill or system of skills. Defines the structure of the help file, the behaviour of the HELP! and HELP! TRIGGER triggers, and the resolution procedure when multiple systems coexist.

# help — Built-in help system for skills

## Objective

Allow any skill or system of skills to expose contextual help directly from the chat,
via two universal triggers:

| Trigger | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| `HELP!` | Displays a general overview: system name, summary, list of all triggers with a one-line description each |
| `HELP! TRIGGER` | Displays the detailed entry for a specific trigger |

---

## Principle

Each system of skills produces **one dedicated help file**, named `[SYSTEM]_help.md`.
This file is the single source of truth for all `HELP!` responses for that system.

Examples:
- `m_AI_l_help.md` — help for the m_AI_l messaging system
- `rocket_help.md` — help for a rocket plan writing skill
- `game_help.md` — help for an online game building skill

This skill (`help.md`) defines the **shared structure convention** for all such files,
and the **resolution procedure** when multiple `_help.md` files are loaded simultaneously.

## Structure of a [SYSTEM]_help.md file

### 1. Header

```markdown
---
name: [SYSTEM]_help
description: [One sentence describing the system, no jargon]
---
```

### 2. Summary block — source for HELP!

Contains:
- A description of the system in 2-3 sentences maximum, written for end users
- The full list of triggers, formatted as:

```
TRIGGER         [One-line description, no jargon]
```

Example:

```
MAIL!           Reads and archives your new messages
SEND!           Immediately sends a message to a team member
RENEW?          Checks whether this thread is approaching its limits
```

**Authoring rules:**
- One line per trigger, no more
- No file paths, no variable names
- End-user language — the reader does not open `.md` files
- Order triggers by decreasing frequency of use

### 3. Detailed entries — source for HELP! TRIGGER

One entry per trigger. Required format:

```markdown
### TRIGGER
What it does   : [Full description, 1 to 3 sentences]
When to use    : [Concrete usage context]
Example        : [A realistic user input and its expected result]
See also       : [Related triggers — omit this line if none]
```

**Authoring rules:**
- Non-developer language — no jargon, no file paths
- The example must be concrete and short — one line if possible
- "See also" only lists triggers defined in the same `_help.md` file

**Note — shared prefix grouping:** commands sharing a common prefix (e.g. `INVITE READ` / `INVITE WRITE`) may include a gateway entry for the prefix itself (e.g. `### INVITE`). When `HELP! INVITE` is called and `INVITE` is not a standalone command, the prefix match rule applies: all entries whose name starts with that prefix are displayed together, including the gateway entry if present.

---

## Runtime behaviour of the triggers

### HELP! — single _help.md file loaded

1. The thread reads the summary block of `[SYSTEM]_help.md`
2. It displays in the chat: system description + trigger list
3. It closes with: `Type HELP! TRIGGER for details on any trigger.`

### HELP! — multiple _help.md files loaded (coexistence)

When several systems are active simultaneously, the thread applies the following procedure:

**1. Enumerate** all `_help.md` files loaded in the session.

**2. Infer** the most likely system from recent context
(last topic discussed, recently used triggers, thread's primary role).

**3. Propose and confirm** before displaying:

```
Are you asking for help on [INFERRED SYSTEM]?
Other available systems: [system B], [system C].
```

The user confirms or selects another system. Help is then displayed.

**Exception — obvious inference** (e.g. the user just used a trigger from system B):
display directly without confirmation.

### HELP! TRIGGER

1. The thread searches for the `### TRIGGER` entry across all loaded `_help.md` files.
2. **Found in one system only**: display directly.
3. **Found in multiple systems**: display both entries, with the system name clearly indicated for each.
4. **Prefix match**: if TRIGGER is not a registered command but matches the shared prefix of several commands (e.g. `INVITE` for `INVITE READ` and `INVITE WRITE`), display all matching detailed entries grouped under a common heading, then close with the standard `See also` links.
5. **Not found**: `Unknown trigger: TRIGGER. Type HELP! to see available triggers.`

## Prerequisites: the documentation triad

To produce a `[SYSTEM]_help.md` file, three elements are required:

| Element | Role |
|---------|------|
| **The system** | The source skills to document |
| **A CDC** | Defines the scope, target audience, triggers to cover, and expected deliverable |
| **`help.md`** | The structure convention and runtime behaviour (this file) |

### Procedure if the CDC is missing

If the documenting agent cannot find a CDC for the system to document, it **does not start** writing. It signals the situation to the user and offers two options:

```
No CDC found for [SYSTEM].
To continue, choose one:

1. Provide an existing CDC.
2. List the files that make up the system
   → I will draft a minimal CDC for your approval before starting.
```

**If the user chooses option 2**, the agent produces a minimal CDC structured as follows and submits it for explicit approval before writing anything:

```markdown
# CDC — [SYSTEM]_help.md (minimal)

## System
[Name and short description of the system]

## Source files
[List of files making up the system]

## Target audience
[One-sentence description]

## Triggers to document
[List of triggers identified from reading the source files]

## Deliverable
[SYSTEM]_help.md — target path: [PATH]
```

The agent waits for explicit user approval before proceeding to authoring.

---

## General rules for all [SYSTEM]_help.md files

- Single flat file — no sub-files, no references to internal architecture
- No file paths must appear in runtime outputs
- Every trigger in the system must have an entry in the summary block **and** a detailed entry
- The file is maintained by the system's author — any change follows the project's validation process

---

## Example session with coexistence

**Context:** the thread has loaded `m_AI_l_help.md` and `rocket_help.md`.
The user has just been discussing orbital trajectories.

**User:** `HELP!`

```
Are you asking for help on rocket (rocket plans)?
Other available systems: m_AI_l (messaging).
```

**User:** `yes`

```
== ROCKET ==
A skill for writing rocket construction plans.

TRIGGERS
--------
STAGE!          Adds a stage to the current plan
FUEL?           Calculates the fuel needed for a trajectory
EXPORT!         Generates the complete plan as a document

Type HELP! TRIGGER for details on any trigger.
```
